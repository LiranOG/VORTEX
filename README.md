 **Interactive relativistic gravitational dynamics — running entirely in your browser.**

VORTEX ETERNITY is a single-file HTML/JavaScript application that makes relativistic gravitational physics interactive and inspectable in real time. It implements Post-Newtonian dynamics up to 2.5PN order, full gravitational-wave emission, and a suite of astrophysical preset scenarios
all rendered live with Three.js/WebGL.

## 📖 Extended Technical Documentation

This repository contains the standalone deployment of VORTEX ETERNITY.
A deeper technical README — covering the full architecture, zero-allocation
hot-path design, cinematic recording system, Tactical Minimap 3.0, and the
complete keyboard reference — is maintained inside the GRANITE-NR ecosystem:

**[→ VORTEX ETERNITY — Full Technical Documentation](https://github.com/LiranOG/Granite-NR/tree/main/viz/vortex_eternity)**

VORTEX serves as the interactive WebGL frontend for the GRANITE numerical
relativity engine, and its extended docs reflect that tighter integration
with the broader simulation ecosystem.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
VORTEX ETERNITY is deliberately a **single self-contained HTML file**. This was a deliberate design constraint: zero build tooling, zero dependency management, instant deployment anywhere.

### Numerical Methods
The integrator uses a **4th-order Hermite predictor-corrector** scheme, which is standard in N-body astrophysics for its energy conservation properties. Kahan compensated summation is applied to accumulated forces to suppress floating-point drift over long integrations.

The Post-Newtonian expansion is implemented through **2.5PN order**, covering:
- **0PN** — Newtonian gravity
- **1PN** — Special-relativistic corrections (periapsis precession)
- **1.5PN** — Gravitomagnetic / spin-orbit coupling
- **2PN** — Conservative relativistic corrections  
- **2.5PN** — Radiation reaction (gravitational-wave energy loss)

> **Known open issue:** The 2PN conservative correction term is currently absent from the PN series — a gap identified during development and planned for a future revision. Energy drift remains below ~0.01% on the standard scenarios.

### Spin Dynamics
Spin precession is computed using the **Rodrigues rotation formula** applied per timestep, accumulating the geodetic (de Sitter) and frame-dragging (Lense-Thirring) contributions. This avoids gimbal lock while remaining computationally lightweight for real-time use.

### Stellar Explosion Visual Effect
![Explosion](assets/Untitled.jpg)
Manually triggered particle explosion demonstrating VORTEX's visual rendering system.
The PN integrator continues running during the effect; ejecta particles interact
gravitationally with surrounding bodies. **Note: cosmetic only — not a physically
modeled merger event.**

## 📊 Telemetry Export

VORTEX exports real-time simulation data as CSV, including:
- Timestep, simulation time
- Per-body: position (x,y,z), velocity (vx,vy,vz), mass, spin
- GW strain (h₊, h×), chirp frequency
- Total energy, angular momentum, energy drift %

This allows offline analysis with Python/NumPy or any data tool.

## 🔭 Development Methodology

VORTEX ETERNITY was developed through **AI-orchestrated implementation** — directing model-generated code against published formulae (Peters 1964, Blanchet 2014, Campanelli 2007), then auditing, integrating, and verifying numerical behavior.

This is an engineering and learning project rather than credentialed research. Its value lies in hands-on intuition for relativistic two-body dynamics and the practical challenges of real-time scientific visualization.
